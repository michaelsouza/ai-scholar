      "agent_summary": "### Search Queries Used\nTo maximize relevance for \"machine learning for preconditioner parameter tuning in sparse linear systems,\" I constructed the following targeted queries, focusing on key terms like ML techniques (e.g., deep/reinforcement learning), preconditioner optimization, and sparse linear algebra contexts:\n- \"machine learning preconditioner parameter tuning sparse linear systems\"\n- \"ML-based optimization of preconditioner parameters for sparse matrices\"\n- \"deep learning for tuning preconditioners in iterative solvers sparse systems\"\n- \"reinforcement learning preconditioner selection sparse linear algebra\"\n\nThese were designed to capture scholarly work on automated, data-driven tuning of preconditioner hyperparameters (e.g., for ILU, multigrid) in sparse solvers like GMRES or CG, while avoiding overly broad results.\n\n### Synthesis\nSearches via the Semantic Scholar API (in unauthenticated mode, which may limit access to full metadata or recent papers) yielded no directly relevant results. This suggests the topic is highly niche, with potentially limited published work explicitly combining ML for *parameter tuning* of preconditioners in sparse systems. Broader related areas (e.g., ML for preconditioner *selection* or general solver optimization) might exist, but no promising papers matched the precise focus.\n\nRecommendations: Refine searches to \"machine learning adaptive preconditioning sparse matrices\" or explore related venues like SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing. If you have access to authenticated APIs or specific keywords (e.g., \"hyperparameter optimization preconditioners\"), I can iterate.",
